# Web Scraping EcoHubMap with Selenium and Python

This repository contains Python scripts to scrape company data from the [EcoHubMap](https://www.ecohubmap.com/) website using Selenium.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `requests`
- `selenium`
- `webdriver-manager`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install requests selenium webdriver-manager
```

## Usage

### 1. `collect_urls.py`

This script collects URLs of companies listed on the EcoHubMap 
website and saves them to a Python file named `urls.py`.

To run the script:

```bash
python collect_urls.py
```

This script will scrape the URLs of all companies listed in the 
"Agriculture" category for the USA. It may take some time to 
complete as it needs to navigate through multiple pages.

### 2. `extractdata.py`

This script extracts company names and email addresses from 
the URLs collected in the `urls.py` file and saves the data 
to a CSV file named `company_emails.csv`.

Before running this script, make sure you have the `urls.py` 
file generated by `collect_urls.py`.

To run the script:

```bash
python extract_data.py
```

This script will iterate through the URLs in `urls.py`, scrape
the company names and email addresses, and save them to a CSV file.

## File Structure

- `collect_urls.py`: Python script to collect URLs of companies
  from the EcoHubMap website.
- `extract_data.py`: Python script to extract company names and
  email addresses from the collected URLs.
- `urls.py`: Python file containing the list of company URLs
  generated by `collect_urls.py`.
- `README.md`: Instructions and overview of the scripts.

## Notes

- Run `collect_urls.py` before `extract_data.py` to
  collect the URLs first.
- You may need to adjust the category and location in `collect_urls.py`
  based on your requirements.
- The scripts use Selenium with Chrome WebDriver.
- Ensure you have Chrome installed and the WebDriver path configured properly.
