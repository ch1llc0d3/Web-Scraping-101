Title: 
Web Scraping Tutorial: Collecting Company URLs and Extracting Names and Emails

Introduction:
In this tutorial, we will learn how to perform web scraping using Python and 
Selenium to collect company URLs from a website listing and then extract company 
names and email addresses from each URL.

Step 1: Setting up the Environment
First, we need to set up our Python environment. Make sure you have Python 
installed on your system along with the necessary packages, including Selenium 
and ChromeDriver. If not, you can install them using pip.

Step 2: Importing Libraries
We start by importing the necessary libraries for our web scraping task. We will 
use Selenium to automate the web browser and BeautifulSoup to parse HTML content.

Step 3: Collecting Company URLs
Our first task is to collect the URLs of companies listed on a website. We will 
use Selenium to navigate through the pages, scroll to the bottom to load all 
content, and extract the URLs.

Step 4: Saving URLs to a Python File
Once we have collected the company URLs, we will save them to a Python file 
named `urls.py`. This file will contain a list of URLs that we can later use 
for further scraping.

Step 5: Extracting Company Names and Emails
Now that we have the company URLs, we can visit each URL and extract the company 
names and email addresses. We will use Selenium to navigate to each URL, find 
the relevant HTML elements containing the company information, and extract 
the desired data.

Step 6: Saving Data to a CSV File
Finally, we will save the extracted company names and email addresses to a 
CSV file for further analysis or storage. We will use the `csv` module 
to create and write data to the CSV file.

Conclusion:
In this tutorial, we learned how to perform web scraping using Python and Selenium. 
We collected company URLs from a website listing, extracted company names and 
email addresses from each URL, and saved the data to a CSV file. This process 
can be applied to various web scraping tasks for data collection and analysis.
